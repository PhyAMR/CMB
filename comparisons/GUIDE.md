# Guide to Interpreting Comparison Results

This document explains the various statistics presented in the comparison markdown files generated by `compare_results.py`. These files provide a detailed comparison of experimental values against Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chain calculations for different cosmological statistics (C180, S12, and XIV).

## File Structure

Each markdown file is titled with the name of the MCMC chain being analyzed (e.g., `# Comparison Summary for chain_planck_1000`). It is then divided into sections for each statistic type: C180, S12, and XIV.

Within each statistic type, individual statistics (e.g., `C180`, `s12_180_60`, `xiv_90_60`) are presented with their respective comparison data.

## Key Metrics and Their Interpretation

For each statistic, you will find the following information:

### 1. Experimental Values
-   **Experimental**: This line shows the observed value from experimental data.
    -   `Exp_Value`: The mean or central value derived from the experimental data.
    -   `Exp_Error`: The uncertainty or error associated with the `Exp_Value`. This typically represents the standard deviation of the experimental measurement.

### 2. MC Simulation Results
-   **MC Simulation**: This line presents the results obtained from Monte Carlo simulations.
    -   `MC_Mean`: The average value of the statistic across all MC simulations. This is the central prediction from the simulations.
    -   `Std`: The **Standard Deviation** of the MC simulation results. This quantifies the spread or variability of the statistic across different simulation runs. It indicates the typical deviation of individual simulation outcomes from the `MC_Mean`.
    -   `Std Err Mean`: The **Standard Error of the Mean** for the MC simulations (`Std / sqrt(N)`, where N is the number of samples). This estimates how much the `MC_Mean` is likely to vary from the true mean of the underlying distribution. It's a measure of the precision of the `MC_Mean`.
    -   `Diff from Exp`: The absolute difference between the `MC_Mean` and the `Exp_Value`. A value close to zero indicates good agreement.
    -   `MC_vs_Exp_Sigma`: This is the "sigma" value, representing the difference between the `MC_Mean` and `Exp_Value` in terms of the combined uncertainty. It's calculated as `sqrt((MC_Mean - Exp_Value)^2 / (Exp_Error^2 + MC_Std^2))`. A value around `1σ` suggests consistency, while larger values (e.g., `>2σ` or `>3σ`) might indicate a significant tension or discrepancy between the simulations and experimental data.

### 3. Chain (MCMC) Results
-   **Chain (Chain_Name)**: This line shows the results from the MCMC chain calculations for a specific chain (e.g., `chain_planck_1000`).
    -   `Chain_Mean`: The mean value of the statistic derived from the MCMC chain. This is the best estimate from the MCMC analysis.
    -   `Std`: The **Standard Deviation** of the MCMC chain samples. Similar to `MC_Std`, this quantifies the spread of the statistic within the chain, indicating the uncertainty of the parameter estimate.
    -   `Std Err Mean`: The **Standard Error of the Mean** for the MCMC chain samples (`Std / sqrt(N)`). This estimates the precision of the `Chain_Mean` as an estimator of the true underlying parameter mean.
    -   `Diff from Exp`: The absolute difference between the `Chain_Mean` and the `Exp_Value`.
    -   `Chain_vs_Exp_Sigma`: Similar to `MC_vs_Exp_Sigma`, this is the "sigma" value comparing the MCMC chain result to the experimental value. It's calculated as `sqrt((Chain_Mean - Exp_Value)^2 / (Exp_Error^2 + Chain_Std^2))`. It helps assess the consistency between the MCMC model and the experimental data.
    -   `Diff from MC`: The absolute difference between the `Chain_Mean` and the `MC_Mean`. This helps to understand how well the MCMC chain's results align with the Monte Carlo simulations.

## Interpreting the Comparison

-   **Consistency with Experiment**: Look at `MC_vs_Exp_Sigma` and `Chain_vs_Exp_Sigma`. Values close to 0 or 1 indicate good agreement. Larger values suggest a potential discrepancy between the model (MC or Chain) and the experimental observations.
-   **Precision**: Compare `Std` and `Std Err Mean` values. A smaller `Std Err Mean` indicates a more precise estimate of the mean.
-   **Model Agreement**: The `Diff from MC` for the Chain results helps to see if the MCMC chain is converging to similar values as the direct Monte Carlo simulations.

By carefully examining these metrics, you can gain insights into the agreement between your theoretical models, simulations, and experimental data.
